I will ask follow-up questions, and together we will set the goals for our collaboration. Each session is based on mutual conversation, asking open-ended questions, psycho-education on relevant topics, moments for reflection, and the use of specific methods. These elements help to shift the perspective on the situation and allow for a more flexible approach to the topic."

        "text": "Since I had been struggling with anxiety for a long time, feeling constantly stressed and sensing that I needed a helping hand, I contacted the psychologist Marie Polášková about a year ago. From the very beginning, she offered me intensive therapy, specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is the best form of therapy for me. During the first few sessions, I was unsure about the therapy, as it is very difficult for me to open up to someone, but over time, I built trust with her, and we started the therapy in full swing! Gradually, we began to uncover potential causes of my stress and anxiety and started working on them together. Mrs. Polášková is the first person who has helped me start working on my anxiety because she always explains everything clearly, and I leave each session with new insights and another method or tool to help me reduce my anxiety and stress so they don't limit me as much in life. She won me over with her character and calm demeanor; I feel tranquility and ease from her because she always has a smile on her face and is always there to offer a helping hand. She is also a very empathetic person who sympathizes with you and always understands the problems you bring to her. Not to mention, she showed me there is nothing to be ashamed of if you start to cry during therapy. I am happy to continue with the therapy because I see certain progress in myself in managing my emotions and anxiety, and for that, I am very grateful to her and thank her so much!"
