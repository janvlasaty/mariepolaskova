I ask additional questions, and together we set the goals for our collaboration. Each session is based on open conversation, asking open-ended questions, psychoeducation on relevant topics, moments of reflection, and the use of specific methods. These elements help change the perspective on the situation and allow for a more flexible approach to the topic."

        "question": "How often will we meet?",
        "answer": "At the beginning, we will meet once a week. After the initial phase of therapy, we will meet 1-2 times a month. Maintenance sessions can then be 1x every 2-3 months. However, the frequency is always based on mutual agreement, and we can adjust it according to your preferences."

        "question": "Do I need to bring anything?",
